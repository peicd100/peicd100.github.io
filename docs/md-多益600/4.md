<span class="tts">Name: Betty Banner

<span class="tts">Date of Flight: September 23

<span class="tts">Departing: Los Angeles

<span class="tts">Arriving: Tokyo

<span class="tts">Reason for Complaint: Booking Error

<span class="tts">Date of Submission: October 20

<span class="tts">Please explain the issue you encountered

<span class="tts">I recently took an international flight to Tokyo with your company, 

<span class="tts">and I am thoroughly unsatisfied with the experience. 

<span class="tts">When booking my flight through your online booking service, 

<span class="tts">I reserved a seat in business class. I paid for this with my credit card and can show the booking fee on my statement. 

<span class="tts">However, when I checked in for the flight, I was told that the counter staff could not find my reservation for business class. 

<span class="tts">Since the flight was leaving soon, I had no other choice but to accept a seat in economy. 

<span class="tts">The person at the counter said they would have someone contact me after I arrived in Tokyo about the mistake. 

<span class="tts">Even after we had taken off, the flight attendants refused to allow me to move to business class,  

<span class="tts">saying my ticket showed economy and that there was nothing they could do.  

<span class="tts">When I arrived in Tokyo, I had to rush to the conference I was supposed to be attending.  

<span class="tts">It has been almost one month and I still have not heard anything. I would like this issue resolved as soon as possible.  

<span class="tts">Please have a member of your company contact me as soon as possible, either through email or after 6pm at my phone number.

 

 

<span class="tts">For your reference, my credit card number is 5555 8899 0989 4399 and my booking number was R593908-43G.  

<span class="tts">I also have a frequent flier membership with your company. The membership number is 3028903893.
