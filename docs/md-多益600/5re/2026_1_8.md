Metro Gallery to Hold Pierre Cousteau Exhibition

by Marjorie Beckham

The Metro Gallery, located near City Hall, is set to hold an exhibition of various works from renowned artist Pierre Cousteau.

Representatives from the Metro Gallery said they are highly enthusiastic to be given the opportunity to display many of his works of art, both new and old.

Originally from Rochefort-en-Terre, Mr. Cousteau began to gain acclaim with his vivid landscape paintings in the realist style.

Said to be able to capture even the smallest of details, Mr. Cousteau quickly rose to prominence.

His earliest works have been known to fetch upwards of twenty million dollars when put up for auction.

After becoming a household name in his native France, Mr. Cousteau later moved to the United States where he began to dabble in other forms of artistic expression.

His work with marble, while originally not as popular as his paintings, quickly gained fame once he began to create sculptures using abstract styling.

Having recently finished an extensive renovation that replaced an aging electrical system and water drainage system,

as well as overhauling its appearance, the Metro Gallery reopened to the public earlier this month.

Originally constructed in the early 1900s, the Metro Gallery began to fall into disrepair in the late 1980s.

A lack of high-profile artists and works, in addition to cut funding to maintain its appearance led to a decrease in patronage.

However, the city government recently stepped in to provide the historic building with new funding in order to preserve the building and restore it to its former glory.

Now officially recognized as a heritage site, funding for the Metro Gallery has been secured for the next thirty years,

allowing it to host the works of famous artists, like Mr. Cousteau.

With a restored look to carry it forward into the twenty-first century,

the Metro Gallery now makes for the perfect venue for the breath-taking and awe-inspiring works of Pierre Cousteau.
