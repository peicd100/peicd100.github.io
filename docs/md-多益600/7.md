W: <span class="tts">Good morning, Rick. I was hoping you could help me out with a problem I'm having.

M: <span class="tts">Of course. What do you need help with?

W: <span class="tts">Well, I'm not sure if you've heard, but I just got promoted to regional manager for our processor manufacturing plant in Asia.

M: <span class="tts">Congratulations! That's fantastic news. 

W: <span class="tts">Thank you. But it means I'm going to have to move there and, well, I'm having trouble finding a place.

M: <span class="tts">Then you've come to the right spot. I can definitely help you find a new apartment. What kind are you looking for?

W: <span class="tts">I don't need anything too spacious, so a studio apartment is fine. But I do need a kitchen and it needs to be furnished.

M: <span class="tts">Not a problem. Anything else?

W: <span class="tts">If it could be a short drive from work and have at least one supermarket nearby, that would be great.

M: <span class="tts">And what kind of a budget are you looking at?

W: <span class="tts">The company will cover half of the rent, so anything under $1200 is fine.

M: <span class="tts">Great. I'll have a look and see what I can find.

<span class="tts">Tom Bradley 14:00



<span class="tts">Hi, Mr. Hart. I'm sending this message to let you know that the pipes in the bathroom of my apartment are leaking quite badly. 

<span class="tts">Also, the noise from the construction site across the road is really loud and distracting. 

<span class="tts">These issues were not mentioned to me at the time of signing the lease.

 
![alt text](images/7/image-5.png)


<span class="tts">Bill Hart 14:03



<span class="tts">Tom, I'm sorry to hear about the problems with your apartment. 

<span class="tts">I was unaware of the leaking problem. Don't worry though, your rental agreement states that the costs of repairs are to be covered by the leaseholder (應為landlord). 

<span class="tts">As for the noise, the construction should wrap up in three weeks.

![alt text](images/7/image-6.png)



<span class="tts">Tom Bradley 14:10



<span class="tts">Three weeks is still a very long time. If possible, I'd rather just end the agreement early and look for a new apartment.

<span class="tts">Bill Hart 14:16



<span class="tts">I'm sorry to hear that. If you would really like to, we can end the lease. But be aware that ending the lease early forfeits your deposit.
