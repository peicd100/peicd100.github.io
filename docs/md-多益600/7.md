W: <span class="tts">Good morning, Rick. I was hoping you could help me out with a problem I'm having.

M: <span class="tts">Of course. What do you need help with?

W: <span class="tts">Well, I'm not sure if you've heard, but I just got promoted to regional manager for our processor manufacturing plant in Asia.

M: <span class="tts">Congratulations! That's fantastic news. 

W: <span class="tts">Thank you. But it means I'm going to have to move there and, well, I'm having trouble finding a place.

M: <span class="tts">Then you've come to the right spot. I can definitely help you find a new apartment. What kind are you looking for?

W: <span class="tts">I don't need anything too spacious, so a studio apartment is fine. But I do need a kitchen and it needs to be furnished.

M: <span class="tts">Not a problem. Anything else?

W: <span class="tts">If it could be a short drive from work and have at least one supermarket nearby, that would be great.

M: <span class="tts">And what kind of a budget are you looking at?

W: <span class="tts">The company will cover half of the rent, so anything under $1200 is fine.

M: <span class="tts">Great. I'll have a look and see what I can find.
