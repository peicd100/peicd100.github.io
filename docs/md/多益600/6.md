W: <span class="tts">The exhibition is set to open next week. We've been working on it for weeks and still haven't got everything ready.

M: <span class="tts">The only major thing to take care of is getting the displays set up.

W: <span class="tts">Yes, but finding a reliable mover who can move so many different types of art safely is proving to be difficult.

W: <span class="tts">I really don't know who we should turn to.

M: <span class="tts">Maybe try talking to Betty in Acquisitions. She's had lots of experience with unusual pieces in exhibitions. 

W: <span class="tts">That's a great idea. I can't believe I didn't think of that myself. Thanks!

<span class="tts">Metro Gallery to Hold Pierre Cousteau Exhibition

<span class="tts">by Marjorie Beckham 


---

<span class="tts">The Metro Gallery, located near City Hall, is set to hold an exhibition of various works from renowned artist Pierre Cousteau. 

<span class="tts">Representatives from the Metro Gallery said they are highly enthusiastic to be given the opportunity to display many of his works of art, both new and old.

 
---



<span class="tts">Originally from Rochefort-en-Terre, Mr. Cousteau began to gain acclaim with his vivid landscape paintings in the realist style. 

<span class="tts">Said to be able to capture even the smallest of details, Mr. Cousteau quickly rose to prominence. 

<span class="tts">His earliest works have been known to fetch upwards of twenty million dollars when put up for auction. 

 

---


<span class="tts">After becoming a household name in his native France, Mr. Cousteau later moved to the United States where he began to dabble in other forms of artistic expression. 

<span class="tts">His work with marble, while originally not as popular as his paintings, quickly gained fame once he began to create sculptures using abstract styling. 


---

<span class="tts">Having recently finished an extensive renovation that replaced an aging electrical system and water drainage system, 

<span class="tts">as well as overhauling its appearance, the Metro Gallery reopened to the public earlier this month. 

<span class="tts">Originally constructed in the early 1900s, the Metro Gallery began to fall into disrepair in the late 1980s. 

<span class="tts">A lack of high-profile artists and works, in addition to cut funding to maintain its appearance led to a decrease in patronage. 

 

---


<span class="tts">However, the city government recently stepped in to provide the historic building with new funding in order to preserve the building and restore it to its former glory. 

<span class="tts">Now officially recognized as a heritage site, funding for the Metro Gallery has been secured for the next thirty years, 

<span class="tts">allowing it to host the works of famous artists, like Mr. Cousteau.

 
---


<span class="tts">With a restored look to carry it forward into the twenty-first century, 

<span class="tts">the Metro Gallery now makes for the perfect venue for the breath-taking and awe-inspiring works of Pierre Cousteau.
